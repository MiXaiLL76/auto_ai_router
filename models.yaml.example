# Model-level RPM configuration
# This file is auto-generated when the router starts and fetches models from credentials
# You can manually edit RPM values for specific models

models:
  - name: gpt-4o
    rpm: 50  # Requests per minute limit for this model

  - name: gpt-4o-mini
    rpm: 100  # Higher limit for cheaper model

  - name: gpt-3.5-turbo
    rpm: 150  # Even higher for fastest model

  - name: text-embedding-3-small
    rpm: 200  # High limit for embeddings

# Notes:
# - If a model is not listed here, default_models_rpm from config.yaml will be used
# - RPM limits are checked AFTER credential RPM limits
# - New models discovered during startup will be automatically added with default_models_rpm
# - You can edit this file and restart the router to apply changes
